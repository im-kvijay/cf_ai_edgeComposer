correct errors and complete a code audit as you hook up portions of vibeSDK. inform me of every change you made and its purpose. then, summarize the state of the entire codebase and project.

implement gptoss in place of llama 3.3. ive attatched the openAI harmony prompt system for you.

suggest plan of action.

explain attatched error.
